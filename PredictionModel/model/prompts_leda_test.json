First of all that without\na mandated to implement keying mechanism this is actually\nunderspecified. The second a discussion on what keying mechanism to use.\n\nTo resolve this I will suggest that we change RECOMMEND to MUST in\nsection C.14 and C.1.5 on using MIKEY with these protocol identifiers.\nThat way we do get a fully specified security mechanism. The only thing\nI need to consider is if MIKEY and SRTP has at least one mandatory to\nimplement mode each so that no further about which sets of mechanism\nmust be supported.\n\nI would agree that DTLS-SRTP is a good idea for transport layer security\nif needed for RTP media streams in RTSP. However, this needs\nspecification work and some considerations. I would also like to point\nout that this do require a bit of special muxing which should be\nexpressed in the protocol string, just like in the SDP case also in\nRTSP. Thus I think using another profile, lower transport combination\nthan for SRTP directly on UDP is warranted for DTLS-SRTP. As this\nrequire job, I think anyone interested in this should define this\nseparately so that we can finish the core RTSP 2.0 spec.\n\nI don't know if the interest is so big for transport level protection,\nalthough I think we shall provide a solution.

If we need to discover STUN servers, too -- and I think we do -- we need that document to expand its scope or a second document.\n\nI recently attended a talk where Matt Peterson presented Burning Man's network.  That network assigns RFC6598 addresses to each Burning Man \"camp\", and their ISP provides CGN'd addresses to Burning Man.  Each camp operates its own WiFi network, and we can all reasonably assume they are using typical consumer or SMB NAPT devices for those networks (e.g., D-Link, Linksys, Ubiquity, etc.).  To avoid tromboning camp-to-camp WebRTC traffic to their ISP's CGN, they would benefit from a STUN and a TURN server within the Burning Man network.

As you suggest, I'm OK with browser tells applications about servers that are available but I would not be keen on browser automatically choosing to use those.

Thanks for the comment.\n\nThe email segment where you should find dialog acts is given below:\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nClearly using RTSP to retrieve the SDP with all the details it needs are\nworkable. However, here we get to the issues:\n\nA client that retrives a SDP with filled in c= lines to a multicast\naddress. What should they do? I don't think we have a clear standardized\nbehavior here. At least two alternatives exist:\n\n1. Stop with RTSP and simple use the SDP, like RTSP describe was SAP or\none downloaded the SDP in HTTP or received it over email.\n\n2. Use RTSP to perform SETUP on the media streams.\n\nIf one do 2 then one comes to the next question:\n\n3. How does I separate this case A) when I simply want to indicate that\nI am listing to a multicast group that I can't affect from B) where I\nwant to ask the server to please deliver the media to a multicast group\nof my choice. To me both A) and B) are valid use cases.\n\n4. What does it mean to perform PLAY on a multicast group where you will\nreceive media as soon as you perform the IGMP join?\n\n5. Are there well defined signaling to have the client understand that\nsending PAUSE will not do anything. Sure trying and failing will carry\nthat message, but unless the client is aware of these cases he might\nthink everything is broken and take error recovery actions.\n\nThe main point I like to make is that we clearly can support some use\ncases around multicast with RTSP. However, it needs to be written up in\nsuch a way that clients and servers are interoperable. I also think it\nwill need to be motivated correctly because otherwise client implementor\nwill not understand why they should care for a case where the client use\nSETUP as way of registering its listing to the multicast group.\n\nIf you can contribute this in draft specification text to RTSP 2.0 we\nclearly can have the WG consider to add it. I personally would like to\nsee it written up. But I have enough to work on the RTSP 2.0 core that I\ndon't going to branch out to cover this.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nPlease assign to the above email segment dialog act types given in quotes in the dialog act hierarchy from above. \nYou may assign multiple dialog act types if appropriate. \nWhere possible you should prefer the more specific dialog act types (second level of the hierarchy) over their more general variants.\n\nPlease output your answer as a single line containing a comma-separated list of assigned dialog act types.\n"}, {"sid": 5195, "prompt": "\nYour task is to find which types of dialog acts occur in an email segment. \nThere is a two level hierarchy of dialog acts described below (dialog act types are given in quotes).\n\n1. \"InformationProviding\" -- Any type of providing information.\n1.1. \"Agreement\" --  Agreeing with opinion or accepting a task.\n1.2. \"Answer\" --  Answering a question.\n1.3. \"ContextSetting\" -- Providing context before other dialog acts.\n1.4. \"Disagreement\" -- Disagreeing with opinion on rejecting a task.\n1.5. \"Extension\" Natural continuation of the previous segment.\n1.6. \"NeutralResponse\" -- Response without clear agreement or disagreement.\n1.7. \"ProposeAction\" -- Propose an actionable activity.\n1.8. \"StateDecision\" -- Explicitly express a decision.\n2. \"InformationSeeking\" -- Any type of seeking information \n2.1. \"ClarificationElicitation\" Expresses need for further elaboration.\n2.2. \"Question\" Any type of question.\n3. \"Social\" -- Social acts (thanking, apologizing etc.) \n3.1. \"Thanking\" -- Conveying thanks.

Note, BTW, that case A) is what is already described as an\nexample in section 14.4 of RFC 2326 (RTSP 1.0); it's also the\n\"Multicast, server chooses address\" option described in section 1.6.\nSo there's really nothing weird or unusual about this.  Several\nexisting clients (including VLC and QuickTime Player) support this,\nand have done so for years.  It continues to baffle me that so many\npeople think that RTSP is used only for playing unicast streams, when\nthere both documentation and widespread use to the contrary.\n\nAs for how to do case B), once again RTSP 2326 gives an answer - in\nsection 12.39, where - in the description of the \"destination\"\nparameter, it says:\n\"The client may specify the multicast address with the\ndestination parameter.\"\nI.e., a client could specify its chosen multicast address using the\n\"destination\" parameter in the \"Transport:\" header in the RTSP\n\"SETUP\" request.  However, I don't know of any clients that support\nthis, and there are probably few (if any) servers that support it,\nbecause of the potential for denial-of-service attacks (an issue\nwhich is also described in section 12.39).\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nPlease assign to the above email segment dialog act types given in quotes in the dialog act hierarchy from above. \nYou may assign multiple dialog act types if appropriate. \nWhere possible you should prefer the more specific dialog act types (second level of the hierarchy) over their more general variants.\n\nPlease output your answer as a single line containing a comma-separated list of assigned dialog act types.\n"}, {"sid": 5196, "prompt": "\nYour task is to find which types of dialog acts occur in an email segment. \nThere is a two level hierarchy of dialog acts described below (dialog act types are given in quotes).\n\n1. \"InformationProviding\" -- Any type of providing information.\n1.1. \"Agreement\" --  Agreeing with opinion or accepting a task.\n1.2. \"Answer\" --  Answering a question.\n1.3. \"ContextSetting\" -- Providing context before other dialog acts.\n1.4. \"Disagreement\" -- Disagreeing with opinion on rejecting a task.\n1.5. \"Extension\" Natural continuation of the previous segment.\n1.6. \"NeutralResponse\" -- Response without clear agreement or disagreement.\n1.7. \"ProposeAction\" -- Propose an actionable activity.\n1.8. \"StateDecision\" -- Explicitly express a decision.\n2. \"InformationSeeking\" -- Any type of seeking information \n2.1. \"ClarificationElicitation\" Expresses need for further elaboration.\n2.2. \"Question\" Any type of question.\n3. \"Social\" -- Social acts (thanking, apologizing etc.) \n3.1. \"Thanking\" -- Conveying thanks.

Thus unless\none creates an RTSP session Teardown doesn't have any context to operate on.\n\nSecondary, the problem with standard RTSP is that the meaning of RTSP\nSETUP with Transport header specifying a destination of a multicast\ngroup is ambiguous. As I see there are two alternative semantics:\n\n1. Please setup media delivery to this provided multicast group. Thus\nRTSP is the multicast group owners way of controlling media being\ndelivered to the media delivery channel.\n\n2. Bind a client to a pre-existing multicast delivery channel to allow\nfor extended unicast signalling around the provided media.

Thanks for the comment.\n\nThe email segment where you should find dialog acts is given below:\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nI would say that this is just an example of one more case of RFC 2326\nbrokenness. Yes, re-reading the text that exist around session IDs\nindicate that the RTSP session could be generated in other ways than\nusing SETUP. However, how this is accomplished or how one actually can\nuse that state isn't specified. There is one hint that dynamic RTSP URIs\ncould be used to indicate a specific session. But, nothing is specified\nthat makes this implementable. Open issues that I directly see are:\n\n- How to go from a URI to a session ID header?\n\n- In which methods that one can use this and how the operations affect\nthe state machine?\n\n- What happens to the session identified when one does Teardown?\n\nI would also like to point out that using the same session ID for\nmultiple clients are not allowed according to this text in section 12.37:\n\nNote that a session identifier identifies a RTSP session across\ntransport sessions or connections. Control messages for more than one\nRTSP URL may be sent within a single RTSP session. Hence, it is\npossible that clients use the same session for controlling many\nstreams constituting a presentation, as long as all the streams come\nfrom the same server. (See example in Section 14). However, multiple\n\"user\" sessions for the same URL from the same client MUST use\ndifferent session identifiers.\n\nSo I would still say that there only exist an embryo to potential\nsolutions for what you want to do. And if you expect RTSP 1.0 clients to\ndo something like this then I wouldn't expect interoperability. I would\nbe surprised if any has the functionality.\n\nAs I see it the right way forward would be to discuss this in the\ncontext of changes and extensions to RTSP 2.0 that would allow what you\nwant to be worked into a coherent behavior.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nPlease assign to the above email segment dialog act types given in quotes in the dialog act hierarchy from above. \nYou may assign multiple dialog act types if appropriate. \nWhere possible you should prefer the more specific dialog act types (second level of the hierarchy) over their more general variants.\n\nPlease output your answer as a single line containing a comma-separated list of assigned dialog act types.\n"}, {"sid": 5229, "prompt": "\nYour task is to find which types of dialog acts occur in an email segment. \nThere is a two level hierarchy of dialog acts described below (dialog act types are given in quotes).\n\n1. \"InformationProviding\" -- Any type of providing information.\n1.1. \"Agreement\" --  Agreeing with opinion or accepting a task.\n1.2. \"Answer\" --  Answering a question.\n1.3. \"ContextSetting\" -- Providing context before other dialog acts.\n1.4. \"Disagreement\" -- Disagreeing with opinion on rejecting a task.\n1.5. \"Extension\" Natural continuation of the previous segment.\n1.6. \"NeutralResponse\" -- Response without clear agreement or disagreement.\n1.7. \"ProposeAction\" -- Propose an actionable activity.\n1.8. \"StateDecision\" -- Explicitly express a decision.\n2. \"InformationSeeking\" -- Any type of seeking information \n2.1. \"ClarificationElicitation\" Expresses need for further elaboration.\n2.2. \"Question\" Any type of question.\n3. \"Social\" -- Social acts (thanking, apologizing etc.) \n3.1. \"Thanking\" -- Conveying thanks.

Several parties in the conference may take turns 'pushing the remote\ncontrol buttons' \".\nSo far I have interpreted RTSP to be a control mechanism that allows sharing\nof the controls [for shared resources, such as multicast streams, where this\nmakes sense].\nHow the session identifier is distributed was out of the scope, but that I'd\nhave SDP considered for.\n\nI interpreted the last sentence of your quoted paragraph with respect to\nmultiple dedicated streams. When starting a RealPlayer twice for example on\nthe same host, requesting the same file will generate two streams (two\nsessions).\n\nThis was the base of my second idea for our use case to have all clients keep\nalive the one session the server controls; and the session identifier I'd\nhave taken from SDP (for example the 's' field).\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nPlease assign to the above email segment dialog act types given in quotes in the dialog act hierarchy from above. \nYou may assign multiple dialog act types if appropriate. \nWhere possible you should prefer the more specific dialog act types (second level of the hierarchy) over their more general variants.\n\nPlease output your answer as a single line containing a comma-separated list of assigned dialog act types.\n"}, {"sid": 5230, "prompt": "\nYour task is to find which types of dialog acts occur in an email segment. \nThere is a two level hierarchy of dialog acts described below (dialog act types are given in quotes).\n\n1. \"InformationProviding\" -- Any type of providing information.\n1.1. \"Agreement\" --  Agreeing with opinion or accepting a task.\n1.2. \"Answer\" --  Answering a question.\n1.3. \"ContextSetting\" -- Providing context before other dialog acts.\n1.4. \"Disagreement\" -- Disagreeing with opinion on rejecting a task.\n1.5. \"Extension\" Natural continuation of the previous segment.\n1.6. \"NeutralResponse\" -- Response without clear agreement or disagreement.\n1.7. \"ProposeAction\" -- Propose an actionable activity.\n1.8. \"StateDecision\" -- Explicitly express a decision.\n2. \"InformationSeeking\" -- Any type of seeking information \n2.1. \"ClarificationElicitation\" Expresses need for further elaboration.\n2.2. \"Question\" Any type of question.\n3. \"Social\" -- Social acts (thanking, apologizing etc.) \n3.1. \"Thanking\" -- Conveying thanks.

Something that I would claim is not in place in\neither RFC 2326 or in the RTSP 2.0 draft.\n\nIf you go read RTSP 2.0 it says in section 3.4 (version 18):\n\nIf one has an established conference or group session, it is possible\nto have an RTSP server distribute media to the whole group.\nTransmission to the group is simplest when controlled by a single\nparticipant or leader of the conference.

Thanks for the comment.\n\nThe email segment where you should find dialog acts is given below:\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nI want to point out that all methods suggested for RTP media through\nfirewalls that do not allow UDP traffic, by using \"always open\" https port\n443 (or http port 80) result in tunneling RTP media over TCP. That gives\nwith severe quality problems from TCP retransmissions of dropped media\npacket packets. Do we really want that for WebRTC?\n\nA quality wise better solution is already pointed out in use case 3.2.5.1\nmentioned below:\n\"An enterprise that uses a RTCWEB based web application for communication\ndesires to audit all RTCWEB based application session used from inside the\ncompany towards any external peer. To be able to do this they deploy a TURN\nserver that straddle the boundary\nbetween the internal network and the external\"\n\nI suggest the following is added to that use case:\n\"Such TURN server allows a media path, separated from the usually data\ncrowded enterprise Internet access, offering superior quality. This is a\nbetter way to enable WebRTC on a network behind a restrictive firewall not\nallowing UDP traffic, instead of tunneling RTP through always open http or\nhttps ports resulting in RTP media over TCP \u0096 with severe quality problems\nfrom TCP retransmissions of dropped packets.\n\nSuch network administrator provided auditing TURN server would also put the\nright party in control \u0096 The network administrator decides what is allowed\non his network.\"\n\nWhy should a network administrator that wants to block webrtc media, have to\ndo more than just closing his firewall for UDP, like below suggested\n\"configuring the browser not to do webrtc, normal HTTP black/white lists,\nand solutions based on putting something in the HTTP Connect sent to the\nproxy so the proxy can block it\"?\n\nAnother thing in the second half of the same use case 3.2.5.1:\nAre NAT/firewalls inside the enterprise network assumed? If not, I think the\nsecond half can be deleted.\n\n\" In cases where employees are using RTCWEB applications provided by an\nexternal service provider they still want to have the traffic to stay\ninside their internal network and in addition not load the straddling\nTURN server, \"\n\nICE establishes a direct connection in this case, not using any TURN server\nat all, doesn\u0092t it?

This happens all over the place, not just here, of course,\nwhich leads to the question of what can we do to avoid getting locked into\nthe draft interfaces.  It's easy to point fingers and say that the\nsoftware authors should know to have a transition strategy if they ship\na protocol that is explicitly a work in progress, but that doesn't really\nseem very productive.  The TLS 1.3 story seems fairly reasonable, with\na scheme to indicate support for a specific draft version as opposed to\nhaving to squat on the version number for the final protcol, but that\nseems to have evolved semi-organically as I understand it, with informal\ncontact among the early implementors.  Should all drafts burn a set of\ncodepoints and map them to the given draft versions?  Probably not.\nShould they think about it?  Maybe.

So you're looking for a \"cleaner\" design?\n\nWhile SHA2-512 expanded to 912 bits is an \"ad-hoc\" construction?\nAnd you want to avoid legacy baggage?\n\nIf so, the choice is between a cleaner forward-looking design, and\na pragmatic what can we use with off-the-shelf code today design.\n\nThe downside of the forward-looking design is that code for both\nSHAKE256 and SHA2-256 would likely be needed in a complete protocol\nimplementation.\n\nI think a relevant question then is how soon would SHAKE256 be\nneeded anyway (because it ends up in TLS ciphersuites or other\nprotocol components in a complete system).\n\nIf SHAKE256 support is a likely near term requirement in many\napplications anyway, then we're not saving anyone code-space with\na SHA2-512 ad-hoc construction.  In the long-run, we may be imposing\na code-space cost, if SHA2-512 is mostly deprecated by SHAKE256\nsome day in the all the other algorithm slots of complete systems.\n\nIs it the group's best guess that SHAKE256 will become \"essential\"\nsoon enough, and ultimately preferred to SHA512?  If so, that seems\nthe wiser long-term choice.\n\nOr is it the case that SHA2-512 is likely with us for the long-haul\n(long enough for EC to be obsoleted by scalable Quantum Computers)?\nIn which case allowing immediate implementation with off-the-shelf\ncode without introducing a new SHAKE256 requirement may be the more\npragmatic option.\n\nViktor.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nPlease assign to the above email segment dialog act types given in quotes in the dialog act hierarchy from above. \nYou may assign multiple dialog act types if appropriate. \nWhere possible you should prefer the more specific dialog act types (second level of the hierarchy) over their more general variants.\n\nPlease output your answer as a single line containing a comma-separated list of assigned dialog act types.\n"}, {"sid": 1331, "prompt": "\nYour task is to find which types of dialog acts occur in an email segment. \nThere is a two level hierarchy of dialog acts described below (dialog act types are given in quotes).\n\n1. \"InformationProviding\" -- Any type of providing information.\n1.1. \"Agreement\" --  Agreeing with opinion or accepting a task.\n1.2. \"Answer\" --  Answering a question.\n1.3. \"ContextSetting\" -- Providing context before other dialog acts.\n1.4. \"Disagreement\" -- Disagreeing with opinion on rejecting a task.\n1.5. \"Extension\" Natural continuation of the previous segment.\n1.6. \"NeutralResponse\" -- Response without clear agreement or disagreement.\n1.7. \"ProposeAction\" -- Propose an actionable activity.\n1.8. \"StateDecision\" -- Explicitly express a decision.\n2. \"InformationSeeking\" -- Any type of seeking information \n2.1. \"ClarificationElicitation\" Expresses need for further elaboration.\n2.2. \"Question\" Any type of question.\n3. \"Social\" -- Social acts (thanking, apologizing etc.) \n3.1. \"Thanking\" -- Conveying thanks.

That would reduce the number of distinct crypto\nprimitives needed for a single Ed448ph implementation.\n\n2) Naming of the pre-hashed variants of Ed25519 and Ed448 and the\nrelationship between PureEdDSA and HashEdDSA.\nI believe we definitely should not use the name 'Ed25519' to describe\nwhat we are doing in the pre-hash variant since that is already well\nestablished in deployment to refer to, eh well, Ed25519.

I looked at this very draft\nagain just yesterday, but somehow didn't notice the file transfer bit.\nOn a side note, when looking through the requirements derived from this\nuse case now, I got the impression that it would have been more\nreader-friendly to write:\n\"In addition to the Simple Video Communication Service use-case, this\nuse-case has the following requirements:\"  and list just the new ones.\n\nSecond: I don't think that there are additional requirements derived\nfrom that, but it can have architectural implications. (i.e. what is\nderived is, perhaps, a new property).  =>  \"file transfer\" should then\nbe a part of the use cases on the list in the slide set I mentioned.\n(I'm saying that because the slide asks: \"others?\")\n\nGiven that file transfers are \"part of the plan\", I just think it's\nimportant for all of us to understand that there may be a lot of data\ntraffic too (instead of pictures, people may be sending a movie... or\nyou could even have a website offering *nothing but* a file transfer\nservice?! I have a feeling that this could even turn into an unintended\n\"killer app\" for rtcweb  :-)   ).\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nPlease assign to the above email segment dialog act types given in quotes in the dialog act hierarchy from above. \nYou may assign multiple dialog act types if appropriate. \nWhere possible you should prefer the more specific dialog act types (second level of the hierarchy) over their more general variants.\n\nPlease output your answer as a single line containing a comma-separated list of assigned dialog act types.\n"}, {"sid": 1383, "prompt": "\nYour task is to find which types of dialog acts occur in an email segment. \nThere is a two level hierarchy of dialog acts described below (dialog act types are given in quotes).\n\n1. \"InformationProviding\" -- Any type of providing information.\n1.1. \"Agreement\" --  Agreeing with opinion or accepting a task.\n1.2. \"Answer\" --  Answering a question.\n1.3. \"ContextSetting\" -- Providing context before other dialog acts.\n1.4. \"Disagreement\" -- Disagreeing with opinion on rejecting a task.\n1.5. \"Extension\" Natural continuation of the previous segment.\n1.6. \"NeutralResponse\" -- Response without clear agreement or disagreement.\n1.7. \"ProposeAction\" -- Propose an actionable activity.\n1.8. \"StateDecision\" -- Explicitly express a decision.\n2. \"InformationSeeking\" -- Any type of seeking information \n2.1. \"ClarificationElicitation\" Expresses need for further elaboration.\n2.2. \"Question\" Any type of question.\n3. \"Social\" -- Social acts (thanking, apologizing etc.) \n3.1. \"Thanking\" -- Conveying thanks.

If the goal is to support the best video quality\npossible (e.g. highest frame rate/quality/resolution supportable on the path), then starting a file transfer on\nthe same path may require the video to reduce bandwidth usage.

And then I review what\nSET and GET parameter actually says. The issue is that as when one want\nto use message body in GET and SET one can't do it without including the\nmessage body in the request. Thus Accept's pattern does not work. Accept\nworks fine for DESCRIBE, where one requests a resource and the response\nmessage body must be one which the requesting agent supports.

(see also URL:\nhttps://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Publications/sp/800-56a/rev-3/draft/documents/sp800-56ar3-draft.pdf\nsection 5.5.1 and Appendix E which allow RFC3526 and RFC7919 groups)\n\nFor myself, I tend to think that using 2048-bit prime P FFC Diffie-Hellman provable primes that are generated on a bi-weekly basis with Q as a large subgroup of approximately P/2 bits in length and G is a proper generator of q-ordered subgroups. If changed often enough, then there would be no big push to try to precalcualte the majority of the factors of such parameters. Even if we have sufficient sieves to help in factorization, there is still a lot of computation behind breaking a large subgroup. In a Post-Quantum Cryptography world, I tend to trust large FFC calculations over small ECC calculations. Although something better than either would be welcome... always allowing it is desirable to still be able to connect to small embedded devices too.\n\nWith RFC4419 and RFC8270 we get safe primes generated with P being a 2048-bits or larger prime. The only downside is that the example calcuation does not always choose a generator g which generates a q-ordered subgroup.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nPlease assign to the above email segment dialog act types given in quotes in the dialog act hierarchy from above. \nYou may assign multiple dialog act types if appropriate. \nWhere possible you should prefer the more specific dialog act types (second level of the hierarchy) over their more general variants.\n\nPlease output your answer as a single line containing a comma-separated list of assigned dialog act types.\n"}, {"sid": 6941, "prompt": "\nYour task is to find which types of dialog acts occur in an email segment. \nThere is a two level hierarchy of dialog acts described below (dialog act types are given in quotes).\n\n1. \"InformationProviding\" -- Any type of providing information.\n1.1. \"Agreement\" --  Agreeing with opinion or accepting a task.\n1.2. \"Answer\" --  Answering a question.\n1.3. \"ContextSetting\" -- Providing context before other dialog acts.\n1.4. \"Disagreement\" -- Disagreeing with opinion on rejecting a task.\n1.5. \"Extension\" Natural continuation of the previous segment.\n1.6. \"NeutralResponse\" -- Response without clear agreement or disagreement.\n1.7. \"ProposeAction\" -- Propose an actionable activity.\n1.8. \"StateDecision\" -- Explicitly express a decision.\n2. \"InformationSeeking\" -- Any type of seeking information \n2.1. \"ClarificationElicitation\" Expresses need for further elaboration.\n2.2. \"Question\" Any type of question.\n3. \"Social\" -- Social acts (thanking, apologizing etc.) \n3.1. \"Thanking\" -- Conveying thanks.

For nist curves, the verification is about\npublic key, not shared secret, it's just performed in the same step.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nPlease assign to the above email segment dialog act types given in quotes in the dialog act hierarchy from above. \nYou may assign multiple dialog act types if appropriate. \nWhere possible you should prefer the more specific dialog act types (second level of the hierarchy) over their more general variants.\n\nPlease output your answer as a single line containing a comma-separated list of assigned dialog act types.\n"}, {"sid": 4711, "prompt": "\nYour task is to find which types of dialog acts occur in an email segment. \nThere is a two level hierarchy of dialog acts described below (dialog act types are given in quotes).\n\n1. \"InformationProviding\" -- Any type of providing information.\n1.1. \"Agreement\" --  Agreeing with opinion or accepting a task.\n1.2. \"Answer\" --  Answering a question.\n1.3. \"ContextSetting\" -- Providing context before other dialog acts.\n1.4. \"Disagreement\" -- Disagreeing with opinion on rejecting a task.\n1.5. \"Extension\" Natural continuation of the previous segment.\n1.6. \"NeutralResponse\" -- Response without clear agreement or disagreement.\n1.7. \"ProposeAction\" -- Propose an actionable activity.\n1.8. \"StateDecision\" -- Explicitly express a decision.\n2. \"InformationSeeking\" -- Any type of seeking information \n2.1. \"ClarificationElicitation\" Expresses need for further elaboration.\n2.2. \"Question\" Any type of question.\n3. \"Social\" -- Social acts (thanking, apologizing etc.) \n3.1. \"Thanking\" -- Conveying thanks.

Thanks for the comment.\n\nThe email segment where you should find dialog acts is given below:\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nI think this misunderstands the scope of the GSS draft.\n\nThe GSS draft discusses GSS key exchange methods for SSH. These are not the\nmain key exchange methods for SSH, they are a *version* of the main key\nexchange methods for use with GSS.\n\nBecause these are a *version* of the main key exchange methods, the main\nvalue of this draft is that it updates the GSS key exchange methods to be\nin line with how the main key exchange methods for SSH have evolved.\n\nAs Mark has pointed out, we have already added these key exchange methods\nto SSH in RFC 8268:\n\ndiffie-hellman-group14-sha256\ndiffie-hellman-group15-sha512\ndiffie-hellman-group16-sha512\ndiffie-hellman-group17-sha512\ndiffie-hellman-group18-sha512\n\nThe whole argument about which groups and which hashes we should have has\nalready been staged, multiple times, and this is what we arrived at.\n\nThe GSS draft is merely mirroring what we have already done for use with\nthe GSS key exchange methods. It does not make sense for the GSS key\nexchange methods to do something entirely different than what the main key\nexchange methods do. It makes sense for the GSS key exchange methods to be\nconsistent with what we have already done for the main ones.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nPlease assign to the above email segment dialog act types given in quotes in the dialog act hierarchy from above. \nYou may assign multiple dialog act types if appropriate. \nWhere possible you should prefer the more specific dialog act types (second level of the hierarchy) over their more general variants.\n\nPlease output your answer as a single line containing a comma-separated list of assigned dialog act types.\n"}, {"sid": 4747, "prompt": "\nYour task is to find which types of dialog acts occur in an email segment. \nThere is a two level hierarchy of dialog acts described below (dialog act types are given in quotes).\n\n1. \"InformationProviding\" -- Any type of providing information.\n1.1. \"Agreement\" --  Agreeing with opinion or accepting a task.\n1.2. \"Answer\" --  Answering a question.\n1.3. \"ContextSetting\" -- Providing context before other dialog acts.\n1.4. \"Disagreement\" -- Disagreeing with opinion on rejecting a task.\n1.5. \"Extension\" Natural continuation of the previous segment.\n1.6. \"NeutralResponse\" -- Response without clear agreement or disagreement.\n1.7. \"ProposeAction\" -- Propose an actionable activity.\n1.8. \"StateDecision\" -- Explicitly express a decision.\n2. \"InformationSeeking\" -- Any type of seeking information \n2.1. \"ClarificationElicitation\" Expresses need for further elaboration.\n2.2. \"Question\" Any type of question.\n3. \"Social\" -- Social acts (thanking, apologizing etc.) \n3.1. \"Thanking\" -- Conveying thanks.

Especially TLS.  They get new cryptosystems and new ways of using those cryptosystems.  They have many extension specs written by many different people, some of which may be rather unlikely to change and would therefore need to be superseded, compounding the legacy headache.\n\nContexts are there so that you can domain-separate two extensions or other uses of a key, without changing the specs to both of them \u2014 or, conceivably, to either of them, if you define a way to determine the context for a given extension.\n\nI understand that this doesn\u2019t protect people who use older signature schemes that don\u2019t have contexts.  It is merely a defense in depth, but this seems appropriate for what is already a paranoid-level curve.\n\nIf you don\u2019t use the contexts, they cost a couple paragraphs in the spec, one extra byte passed to a hash function, and (if the library supports with and without) one extra function in the library API.  I hope that this is still little enough complexity that the potential gains outweigh the risks.  If not, I don\u2019t have a huge problem with removing them, but I still think it\u2019s important to distinguish prehashed and non-prehashed modes.\n\n\u2014 Mike\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nPlease assign to the above email segment dialog act types given in quotes in the dialog act hierarchy from above. \nYou may assign multiple dialog act types if appropriate. \nWhere possible you should prefer the more specific dialog act types (second level of the hierarchy) over their more general variants.\n\nPlease output your answer as a single line containing a comma-separated list of assigned dialog act types.\n"}, {"sid": 1417, "prompt": "\nYour task is to find which types of dialog acts occur in an email segment. \nThere is a two level hierarchy of dialog acts described below (dialog act types are given in quotes).\n\n1. \"InformationProviding\" -- Any type of providing information.\n1.1. \"Agreement\" --  Agreeing with opinion or accepting a task.\n1.2. \"Answer\" --  Answering a question.\n1.3. \"ContextSetting\" -- Providing context before other dialog acts.\n1.4. \"Disagreement\" -- Disagreeing with opinion on rejecting a task.\n1.5. \"Extension\" Natural continuation of the previous segment.\n1.6. \"NeutralResponse\" -- Response without clear agreement or disagreement.\n1.7. \"ProposeAction\" -- Propose an actionable activity.\n1.8. \"StateDecision\" -- Explicitly express a decision.\n2. \"InformationSeeking\" -- Any type of seeking information \n2.1. \"ClarificationElicitation\" Expresses need for further elaboration.\n2.2. \"Question\" Any type of question.\n3. \"Social\" -- Social acts (thanking, apologizing etc.) \n3.1. \"Thanking\" -- Conveying thanks.

There are devices/software that do things upon receipt of RTP packets (like play them out through loudspeakers, or initiate ringing of the softphone), and more important RTP packets are not carefully designed to avoid imitating other types of traffic such as SNMP, whereas STUN packets contain a relatively large header with a magic number that makes them much less likely to be misinterpreted by other protocols.\n\nAdditionally the STUN connectivity check used for ICE contains short-term credentials and a transaction ID that is unknown to the signaling layer (or Javascript) that ensure that you are in fact conducting a pairwise negotiation with the far end that you are thinking of. With RTP/RTCP packets alone you can create attacks both from the browser (by sending RTP/RTCP and using something else to spoof enough replies that the test passes) or on the browser (by sending it RTP from somewhere else).\n\nAnd of course ICE, or something like it, is required anyway for doing NAT traversal.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nPlease assign to the above email segment dialog act types given in quotes in the dialog act hierarchy from above. \nYou may assign multiple dialog act types if appropriate. \nWhere possible you should prefer the more specific dialog act types (second level of the hierarchy) over their more general variants.\n\nPlease output your answer as a single line containing a comma-separated list of assigned dialog act types.\n"}, {"sid": 1419, "prompt": "\nYour task is to find which types of dialog acts occur in an email segment. \nThere is a two level hierarchy of dialog acts described below (dialog act types are given in quotes).\n\n1. \"InformationProviding\" -- Any type of providing information.\n1.1. \"Agreement\" --  Agreeing with opinion or accepting a task.\n1.2. \"Answer\" --  Answering a question.\n1.3. \"ContextSetting\" -- Providing context before other dialog acts.\n1.4. \"Disagreement\" -- Disagreeing with opinion on rejecting a task.\n1.5. \"Extension\" Natural continuation of the previous segment.\n1.6. \"NeutralResponse\" -- Response without clear agreement or disagreement.\n1.7. \"ProposeAction\" -- Propose an actionable activity.\n1.8. \"StateDecision\" -- Explicitly express a decision.\n2. \"InformationSeeking\" -- Any type of seeking information \n2.1. \"ClarificationElicitation\" Expresses need for further elaboration.\n2.2. \"Question\" Any type of question.\n3. \"Social\" -- Social acts (thanking, apologizing etc.) \n3.1. \"Thanking\" -- Conveying thanks.

For example it would be an astronmoical coincidence for any given RTP packet to be parsable as SNMP BER for a given ASN.1 dictionary.\n(Also as an aside, if I recall correctly SNMP is actually distinguishable from RTP by the first byte)\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nPlease assign to the above email segment dialog act types given in quotes in the dialog act hierarchy from above. \nYou may assign multiple dialog act types if appropriate. \nWhere possible you should prefer the more specific dialog act types (second level of the hierarchy) over their more general variants.\n\nPlease output your answer as a single line containing a comma-separated list of assigned dialog act types.\n"}, {"sid": 5655, "prompt": "\nYour task is to find which types of dialog acts occur in an email segment. \nThere is a two level hierarchy of dialog acts described below (dialog act types are given in quotes).\n\n1. \"InformationProviding\" -- Any type of providing information.\n1.1. \"Agreement\" --  Agreeing with opinion or accepting a task.\n1.2. \"Answer\" --  Answering a question.\n1.3. \"ContextSetting\" -- Providing context before other dialog acts.\n1.4. \"Disagreement\" -- Disagreeing with opinion on rejecting a task.\n1.5. \"Extension\" Natural continuation of the previous segment.\n1.6. \"NeutralResponse\" -- Response without clear agreement or disagreement.\n1.7. \"ProposeAction\" -- Propose an actionable activity.\n1.8. \"StateDecision\" -- Explicitly express a decision.\n2. \"InformationSeeking\" -- Any type of seeking information \n2.1. \"ClarificationElicitation\" Expresses need for further elaboration.\n2.2. \"Question\" Any type of question.\n3. \"Social\" -- Social acts (thanking, apologizing etc.) \n3.1. \"Thanking\" -- Conveying thanks.

But I\n> think there's a way to prevent the hammer attack without\n> using ICE, and without requiring legacy VoIP devices to\n> change whatsoever.\n> One way would be to use the receipt of RTP as an indicator\n> the far-end expects to receive it from you.  So have the\n> browser generate RTP/RTCP packets, at a relatively slow rate,\n> for a short duration (e.g., use the same rate/retransmit\n> timers of STUN connectivity checks in ICE).  If the browser\n> receives RTP/RTCP packets, then the far-end expected to\n> receive them as well and the browser can do normal RTP from then on.\n> If this was a hammer attack, this doesn't generate any more\n> load on the target than ICE, since ICE would have sent X\n> number of STUN packets for Y time as well, and I'm suggesting\n> the X and Y be the same values for the initial RTP packets\n> during the \"check\" phase.\n> The major weakness of this approach is that a malicious\n> web-server trying to get your browser to do the voice hammer\n> could send RTP to your browser, since it knows the\n> address/ports of both sides, codec payload types, etc. (i.e.,\n> it can spoof being the attack target to make your browser\n> think it's ok to do normal RTP)  But we could probably play\n> games with RTCP SR/RR or even just require continued RTP\n> receipt to send RTP, in order to mitigate this weakness or\n> make it of low value to exploit.\n[JRE] The problem with requiring continued RTP receipt (or even ANY RTP receipt) is sessions where RTP is one-way, e.g., when mic muted, camera off. With many asymmetric possibilities coming out of the CLUE work, this could be a problem, although it perhaps goes away if everything is multiplexed onto the same port. It depends whether we can expect all legacy devices to behave in a way that would make this work.\n\nJohn\n\nJohn Elwell\nTel: +44 1908 817801 (office and mobile)\nEmail: john.elwell@siemens-enterprise.com\nhttp://www.siemens-enterprise.com/uk/\n\nSiemens Enterprise Communications Limited.\nRegistered office: Brickhill Street, Willen Lake, Milton Keynes, MK15 0DJ.\nRegistered No: 5903714, England.\n\nSiemens Enterprise Communications Limited is a Trademark Licensee of Siemens AG.\n\n> Does anyone else care about interop-ing with legacy\n> non-RTCWEB voip devices?

I'm not suggesting that it's a 1:1 mechanism of receipt/send, nor that it even be very dynamic/real-time.  But sure there will be some cases that it won't work.  But that's no worse than the current state of things, since it won't work to begin with for such devices if ICE is mandated.  We can't achieve 100% interop regardless - I'm just trying for as much as possible.\n\nWith regards to CLUE, I don't consider their devices \"legacy\".
