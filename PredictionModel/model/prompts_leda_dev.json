Especially their desired extensions\nto RTSP and their impact on the RTSP 2.0 core specification. We\nespecially encourage persons from such organizations to participate in\nthis meeting. Third, to discuss issues and ways to progress already\nexisting MMUSIC WG item extensions to RTSP. Fourth, to discuss any RTSP\nextensions proposed to become MMUSIC WG items. The main goal is to help\nensure the timely completion of the RTSP 2.0 core specification while\nensuring that the potential user's requirements have been considered and\nthe necessary extension mechanisms are in place.\n\nThe RTSP 2.0 core specification editors intends to submit an updated\nversion of the draft in good time (2-3 weeks) prior to the meeting to\nallow everyone to prepare. At that time a more detailed agenda will also\nbe published taking requests for topics and the incoming liaisons into\naccount.\n\nParticipants are required to register prior to the event to ensure that\nthe facilities can accommodate the participants. The last day of\nregistration is the 5th of May. Registration shall be sent to\nmagnus.westerlund@ericsson.com with the subject line \"MMUSIC RTSP\ninterim meeting\" indicating the participant's name and also any specific\nagenda requests. The meeting will most likely be held out in Kista (20\nmin subway ride from downtown Stockholm).\n\nAny questions on this event can be directed to the MMUSIC WG chairs\nJoerg Ott (jo@acm.org) and Jean-Francois Mule (jf.mule@cablelabs.com) or\nthe meeting organizer Magnus Westerlund\n(magnus.westerlund@ericsson.com).\n\nReferences:\nCurrent WG documents:\nhttp://tools.ietf.org/wg/mmusic/draft-ietf-mmusic-rfc2326bis/\nhttp://tools.ietf.org/wg/mmusic/draft-ietf-mmusic-rtsp-nat/\nhttp://tools.ietf.org/wg/mmusic/draft-ietf-mmusic-rtsp-nat-evaluation/\n\nRTSP Core issue tracker:\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/rtspspec\nIETF-Announce mailing list\nIETF-Announce@ietf.org\nhttps://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/ietf-announce\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nPlease assign to the above email segment dialog act types given in quotes in the dialog act hierarchy from above. \nYou may assign multiple dialog act types if appropriate. \nWhere possible you should prefer the more specific dialog act types (second level of the hierarchy) over their more general variants.\n\nPlease output your answer as a single line containing a comma-separated list of assigned dialog act types.\n"}, {"sid": 3704, "prompt": "\nYour task is to find which types of dialog acts occur in an email segment. \nThere is a two level hierarchy of dialog acts described below (dialog act types are given in quotes).\n\n1. \"InformationProviding\" -- Any type of providing information.\n1.1. \"Agreement\" --  Agreeing with opinion or accepting a task.\n1.2. \"Answer\" --  Answering a question.\n1.3. \"ContextSetting\" -- Providing context before other dialog acts.\n1.4. \"Disagreement\" -- Disagreeing with opinion on rejecting a task.\n1.5. \"Extension\" Natural continuation of the previous segment.\n1.6. \"NeutralResponse\" -- Response without clear agreement or disagreement.\n1.7. \"ProposeAction\" -- Propose an actionable activity.\n1.8. \"StateDecision\" -- Explicitly express a decision.\n2. \"InformationSeeking\" -- Any type of seeking information \n2.1. \"ClarificationElicitation\" Expresses need for further elaboration.\n2.2. \"Question\" Any type of question.\n3. \"Social\" -- Social acts (thanking, apologizing etc.) \n3.1. \"Thanking\" -- Conveying thanks.

This way, the module name ietf-ssh-server can be used\n(later) to define an instantiation of the groupings for a standalone\nSSH server.\n\nI would suggest the same for the ietf-tls-* modules (even though there\nis not a common standalone TLS server).\n\nSince these modules will have conformance-type 'import' in YANG\nlibrary, I do not really see what the benfit of splitting things\ninto multiple modules. What you implement is defined by the modules\nusing the groupings.\n\n/js\n\nJuergen Schoenwaelder           Jacobs University Bremen gGmbH\nPhone: +49 421 200 3587         Campus Ring 1 | 28759 Bremen | Germany\nFax:   +49 421 200 3103         <http://www.jacobs-university.de/>\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nPlease assign to the above email segment dialog act types given in quotes in the dialog act hierarchy from above. \nYou may assign multiple dialog act types if appropriate. \nWhere possible you should prefer the more specific dialog act types (second level of the hierarchy) over their more general variants.\n\nPlease output your answer as a single line containing a comma-separated list of assigned dialog act types.\n"}, {"sid": 6808, "prompt": "\nYour task is to find which types of dialog acts occur in an email segment. \nThere is a two level hierarchy of dialog acts described below (dialog act types are given in quotes).\n\n1. \"InformationProviding\" -- Any type of providing information.\n1.1. \"Agreement\" --  Agreeing with opinion or accepting a task.\n1.2. \"Answer\" --  Answering a question.\n1.3. \"ContextSetting\" -- Providing context before other dialog acts.\n1.4. \"Disagreement\" -- Disagreeing with opinion on rejecting a task.\n1.5. \"Extension\" Natural continuation of the previous segment.\n1.6. \"NeutralResponse\" -- Response without clear agreement or disagreement.\n1.7. \"ProposeAction\" -- Propose an actionable activity.\n1.8. \"StateDecision\" -- Explicitly express a decision.\n2. \"InformationSeeking\" -- Any type of seeking information \n2.1. \"ClarificationElicitation\" Expresses need for further elaboration.\n2.2. \"Question\" Any type of question.\n3. \"Social\" -- Social acts (thanking, apologizing etc.) \n3.1. \"Thanking\" -- Conveying thanks.

Thanks for the comment.\n\nThe email segment where you should find dialog acts is given below:\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nPeaking at TLS 1.3, draft-ietf-tls-tls13-21#section-4.4.2.2 says:\n\n-  The \"server_name\" and \"certificate_authorities\" extensions\n[RFC6066] are used to *guide certificate selection*.\n\nand in S4.2.4 it says:\n\nThe \"trusted_ca_keys\" extension, which serves a similar purpose\n[RFC6066], but is more complicated, is not used in TLS 1.3 (although\nit may appear in ClientHello messages from clients which are offering\nprior versions of TLS).\n\nSo, there's at least 3 different ways that the server can go about\nselecting which certificates it sends.  To me, this again seems like\nsomething maybe the server's code does internally - e.g., it sifts\nthrough all the certs it has (i.e. list certificate in the YANG model),\nsending the subset matching protocol-level criteria.  Do you know?\n\nPeaking at NGINX config, it seems to have a config like:\n\n+--- server* [ <not sure what the key might be> ]\n+--- listen inet:port    // 443\n+--- server_name string  // example.com\n+--- root        string  // /usr/share/nginx/www\n+--- ssl         Boolean // on\n+--- ssl_certificate     // /etc/nginx/ssl/example.org/server.crt;\n+--- ssl_certificate_key // /etc/nginx/ssl/example.org/server.key;\n\nNote that the TLS-part of the config has been splayed across the\napp-specific config.  By contrast, the groupings we have now are more\nfor a single SSL host (not virtual hosting).  We could add 'sni-to-name'\nmapping structures, but we it be helpful to complex TLS apps like NGINX?\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nPlease assign to the above email segment dialog act types given in quotes in the dialog act hierarchy from above. \nYou may assign multiple dialog act types if appropriate. \nWhere possible you should prefer the more specific dialog act types (second level of the hierarchy) over their more general variants.\n\nPlease output your answer as a single line containing a comma-separated list of assigned dialog act types.\n"}, {"sid": 3739, "prompt": "\nYour task is to find which types of dialog acts occur in an email segment. \nThere is a two level hierarchy of dialog acts described below (dialog act types are given in quotes).\n\n1. \"InformationProviding\" -- Any type of providing information.\n1.1. \"Agreement\" --  Agreeing with opinion or accepting a task.\n1.2. \"Answer\" --  Answering a question.\n1.3. \"ContextSetting\" -- Providing context before other dialog acts.\n1.4. \"Disagreement\" -- Disagreeing with opinion on rejecting a task.\n1.5. \"Extension\" Natural continuation of the previous segment.\n1.6. \"NeutralResponse\" -- Response without clear agreement or disagreement.\n1.7. \"ProposeAction\" -- Propose an actionable activity.\n1.8. \"StateDecision\" -- Explicitly express a decision.\n2. \"InformationSeeking\" -- Any type of seeking information \n2.1. \"ClarificationElicitation\" Expresses need for further elaboration.\n2.2. \"Question\" Any type of question.\n3. \"Social\" -- Social acts (thanking, apologizing etc.) \n3.1. \"Thanking\" -- Conveying thanks.

TLS 1.2 has apparently been designed to leak the prehash\nthat way (TLS 1.3 retains the basic structure, but the amounts\nof data to sign are much smaller).\n\nCan you elaborate on this leak?

As Reinaldo is saying, it would improve robustness it produces explict NAT mappings with explicit durations. Also, it can serve as an alternative to STUN/TURN in case the browser happens to be behind a PCP-capable NAT/FW. So, PCP can be seen as an optimization and should be used when it is available.

It can also make one more likely to treat a specific ECN number as CE than none duplicated packets. Also the downside of dropping any duplicate packet even if CE marked is not significant.

Thanks for the comment.\n\nThe email segment where you should find dialog acts is given below:\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nPacket duplication sometimes occur and it has a potential for affecting the ECN counter for what markings that arrive within a connection. Thus, it would be good if the requirements on how a QUIC implementation handle packets that are detected as duplicates.\n\nThere also appear that there are current text in the transport draft that makes assumption about handling of duplicate packets:\n\n6.10.4.1.  Detecting a Stateless Reset\n\nA client detects a potential stateless reset when a packet with a\nshort header either cannot be decrypted or is marked as a duplicate\npacket.\n\nThe other mention of packet duplication, also pointing to an action that is this:\n\n6.8.3.2.  Handling Address Spoofing by an On-path Attacker\n\nAn on-path attacker could cause a spurious connection migration by\ncopying and forwarding a packet with a spoofed address such that it\narrives before the original packet.  The packet with the spoofed\naddress will be seen to come from a migrating connection, and the\noriginal packet will be seen as a duplicate and dropped.\n\nThese two pieces appear to indicate that packet duplicates should:\n1. Be detected by receiver, at least within the window of PN between highest seen and some window into the past.\n2. The packet marked as duplicate\n3. Duplicate are dropped, but only after having been somewhat processed (see 6.10.4.1).\n\nTo my understanding the smallest window a receiver could have for tracking packets, is what is in ACKs that hasn't been ACKed yet. But that could be extremely short into the past, which could be short in time, compared to the expected re-ordering or packet life time in the network. Independently of window size, if a packet would arrive with a PN that is prior to the current window the receiver have, the receiver has discard the state for the packet number, and thus can't determine if it was ACKed or not, and thus needs to be discarded without further processing. Is that correctly assumed.\n\nThus, it would be good if these assumptions and needed functionality was collected in its own paragraphs somewhere in the specification.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nPlease assign to the above email segment dialog act types given in quotes in the dialog act hierarchy from above. \nYou may assign multiple dialog act types if appropriate. \nWhere possible you should prefer the more specific dialog act types (second level of the hierarchy) over their more general variants.\n\nPlease output your answer as a single line containing a comma-separated list of assigned dialog act types.\n"}, {"sid": 5812, "prompt": "\nYour task is to find which types of dialog acts occur in an email segment. \nThere is a two level hierarchy of dialog acts described below (dialog act types are given in quotes).\n\n1. \"InformationProviding\" -- Any type of providing information.\n1.1. \"Agreement\" --  Agreeing with opinion or accepting a task.\n1.2. \"Answer\" --  Answering a question.\n1.3. \"ContextSetting\" -- Providing context before other dialog acts.\n1.4. \"Disagreement\" -- Disagreeing with opinion on rejecting a task.\n1.5. \"Extension\" Natural continuation of the previous segment.\n1.6. \"NeutralResponse\" -- Response without clear agreement or disagreement.\n1.7. \"ProposeAction\" -- Propose an actionable activity.\n1.8. \"StateDecision\" -- Explicitly express a decision.\n2. \"InformationSeeking\" -- Any type of seeking information \n2.1. \"ClarificationElicitation\" Expresses need for further elaboration.\n2.2. \"Question\" Any type of question.\n3. \"Social\" -- Social acts (thanking, apologizing etc.) \n3.1. \"Thanking\" -- Conveying thanks.

Thanks for the comment.\n\nThe email segment where you should find dialog acts is given below:\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe main point I like to stress, is that there will be a number of long lived connections that never will rekey if they are only based on sent packets. Even if one send 136 packets per second, the sender rekeys only once every year. And there are plenty of applications that will send less than a packet a second on average. The attack outlined is not affecting the number of sent packets by the sender in any significant way, it will only result in sending a lot of packets to the receiver and watch for signs of successful forgery by monitoring what the receiver emits back to the sender. Thus, if one can send 10000 packets a second to the receiver, then one will have had the possibility of sending ~2^38 packet by the time of rekeying. So still a low probability of success but not insignificant.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nPlease assign to the above email segment dialog act types given in quotes in the dialog act hierarchy from above. \nYou may assign multiple dialog act types if appropriate. \nWhere possible you should prefer the more specific dialog act types (second level of the hierarchy) over their more general variants.\n\nPlease output your answer as a single line containing a comma-separated list of assigned dialog act types.\n"}, {"sid": 5814, "prompt": "\nYour task is to find which types of dialog acts occur in an email segment. \nThere is a two level hierarchy of dialog acts described below (dialog act types are given in quotes).\n\n1. \"InformationProviding\" -- Any type of providing information.\n1.1. \"Agreement\" --  Agreeing with opinion or accepting a task.\n1.2. \"Answer\" --  Answering a question.\n1.3. \"ContextSetting\" -- Providing context before other dialog acts.\n1.4. \"Disagreement\" -- Disagreeing with opinion on rejecting a task.\n1.5. \"Extension\" Natural continuation of the previous segment.\n1.6. \"NeutralResponse\" -- Response without clear agreement or disagreement.\n1.7. \"ProposeAction\" -- Propose an actionable activity.\n1.8. \"StateDecision\" -- Explicitly express a decision.\n2. \"InformationSeeking\" -- Any type of seeking information \n2.1. \"ClarificationElicitation\" Expresses need for further elaboration.\n2.2. \"Question\" Any type of question.\n3. \"Social\" -- Social acts (thanking, apologizing etc.) \n3.1. \"Thanking\" -- Conveying thanks.

However, my co-author clarified to me that this is not an issue for untruncated tags. So as long as QUIC uses 128 bit authentication tags for AES-GCM we should have no issue from a cryptographic perspective.\n\nI still think not having any requirement on replay protection at the main protocol level puts a lot of responsibility on the designers of extensions as well as implementers to ensure that things truly are idempotent when sent input.\n\n@kazuho\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nPlease assign to the above email segment dialog act types given in quotes in the dialog act hierarchy from above. \nYou may assign multiple dialog act types if appropriate. \nWhere possible you should prefer the more specific dialog act types (second level of the hierarchy) over their more general variants.\n\nPlease output your answer as a single line containing a comma-separated list of assigned dialog act types.\n"}, {"sid": 1663, "prompt": "\nYour task is to find which types of dialog acts occur in an email segment. \nThere is a two level hierarchy of dialog acts described below (dialog act types are given in quotes).\n\n1. \"InformationProviding\" -- Any type of providing information.\n1.1. \"Agreement\" --  Agreeing with opinion or accepting a task.\n1.2. \"Answer\" --  Answering a question.\n1.3. \"ContextSetting\" -- Providing context before other dialog acts.\n1.4. \"Disagreement\" -- Disagreeing with opinion on rejecting a task.\n1.5. \"Extension\" Natural continuation of the previous segment.\n1.6. \"NeutralResponse\" -- Response without clear agreement or disagreement.\n1.7. \"ProposeAction\" -- Propose an actionable activity.\n1.8. \"StateDecision\" -- Explicitly express a decision.\n2. \"InformationSeeking\" -- Any type of seeking information \n2.1. \"ClarificationElicitation\" Expresses need for further elaboration.\n2.2. \"Question\" Any type of question.\n3. \"Social\" -- Social acts (thanking, apologizing etc.) \n3.1. \"Thanking\" -- Conveying thanks.

Thanks for the comment.\n\nThe email segment where you should find dialog acts is given below:\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nSo, do I assume correctly, that you will still throw away packets that are several RTTs old, i.e. that have a PN number older than any state? Or do you generate an ACK for that old packet that is so old, and try to find if there is any unconsumed buffers to put any data in?\n\nYou might be right in that all existing frames have a behavior that if one applies it twice it already have the handling rules to suppress the duplicate or not cause any downside of being applied twice. I looked through the frame types and the only ones that I think have some impact are:\n* Path_Challenge: A non duplication detecting receiver, will issue two Path_Response frames in response to a single PN. The sender of the Path_Challenge should not react badly to this.\n\nAlso, I haven't considered if there are any new requirements with the handshake packets and the interaction with TLS?\n\nI would note that AES-GCM do have this weakness (Fergueson  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/toolkit/BCM/documents/comments/CWC-GCM/Ferguson2.pdf) that if one manage to know that one successfully forged a packet so that it passed the authentication verification, then one learns a number of bits of the authentication key, making the next forgery simpler. If it is possible to run such an attack by sending modified duplicates with forged authentication tags resulting in a response, then this can be exploited (https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-31517-1_7). So QUIC will not use truncated tags, but QUIC connections may be very long lived in certain environments. Thus making it possible to maintain an attack for a sufficient time to possible have any result. Thus, I think for safety reasons packet duplication suppression after decryption should be mandatory to prevent this information leakage and not put that onto the individual frame types to consider if they will result in reveal of a successful forgery of a modified duplicate packet.\n\nI also noted that when we discussed this at the Interim it appeared that most, if not all except @kazuho was thinking that duplication suppression was expected in the receiver. If this is not required, then think the actual requirements on each frame type individually needs to be very clear.\n\nIt would be good to come to a conclusion on this issue so that we can determine what is needed for the ECN addition (#1372).\n\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/quicwg/base-drafts/issues/1405#issuecomment-398014741\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nPlease assign to the above email segment dialog act types given in quotes in the dialog act hierarchy from above. \nYou may assign multiple dialog act types if appropriate. \nWhere possible you should prefer the more specific dialog act types (second level of the hierarchy) over their more general variants.\n\nPlease output your answer as a single line containing a comma-separated list of assigned dialog act types.\n"}, {"sid": 1669, "prompt": "\nYour task is to find which types of dialog acts occur in an email segment. \nThere is a two level hierarchy of dialog acts described below (dialog act types are given in quotes).\n\n1. \"InformationProviding\" -- Any type of providing information.\n1.1. \"Agreement\" --  Agreeing with opinion or accepting a task.\n1.2. \"Answer\" --  Answering a question.\n1.3. \"ContextSetting\" -- Providing context before other dialog acts.\n1.4. \"Disagreement\" -- Disagreeing with opinion on rejecting a task.\n1.5. \"Extension\" Natural continuation of the previous segment.\n1.6. \"NeutralResponse\" -- Response without clear agreement or disagreement.\n1.7. \"ProposeAction\" -- Propose an actionable activity.\n1.8. \"StateDecision\" -- Explicitly express a decision.\n2. \"InformationSeeking\" -- Any type of seeking information \n2.1. \"ClarificationElicitation\" Expresses need for further elaboration.\n2.2. \"Question\" Any type of question.\n3. \"Social\" -- Social acts (thanking, apologizing etc.) \n3.1. \"Thanking\" -- Conveying thanks.

Then, the sender can get the most information for adjusting the congestion control.\n\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/quicwg/base-drafts/issues/1405#issuecomment-393716871\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nPlease assign to the above email segment dialog act types given in quotes in the dialog act hierarchy from above. \nYou may assign multiple dialog act types if appropriate. \nWhere possible you should prefer the more specific dialog act types (second level of the hierarchy) over their more general variants.\n\nPlease output your answer as a single line containing a comma-separated list of assigned dialog act types.\n"}, {"sid": 1679, "prompt": "\nYour task is to find which types of dialog acts occur in an email segment. \nThere is a two level hierarchy of dialog acts described below (dialog act types are given in quotes).\n\n1. \"InformationProviding\" -- Any type of providing information.\n1.1. \"Agreement\" --  Agreeing with opinion or accepting a task.\n1.2. \"Answer\" --  Answering a question.\n1.3. \"ContextSetting\" -- Providing context before other dialog acts.\n1.4. \"Disagreement\" -- Disagreeing with opinion on rejecting a task.\n1.5. \"Extension\" Natural continuation of the previous segment.\n1.6. \"NeutralResponse\" -- Response without clear agreement or disagreement.\n1.7. \"ProposeAction\" -- Propose an actionable activity.\n1.8. \"StateDecision\" -- Explicitly express a decision.\n2. \"InformationSeeking\" -- Any type of seeking information \n2.1. \"ClarificationElicitation\" Expresses need for further elaboration.\n2.2. \"Question\" Any type of question.\n3. \"Social\" -- Social acts (thanking, apologizing etc.) \n3.1. \"Thanking\" -- Conveying thanks.

If there are no general duplication protection then using a recently sent packet as attack packet is makes it simpler to cause a response. In fact the response to ECN-CE marks can actually be one thing that provides such a proof if some of the response discussed in #1372 would be allowed. Modifying the payload forging the authentication tag and setting the ECN bits to CE could then trigger an ACK on successful forge. For a connection that mostly idle that ACK will be a good signal for a forge. However, for this type of connection one can likely also target packets with a PING frame. Thus, also getting an ACK response on successful forge.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nPlease assign to the above email segment dialog act types given in quotes in the dialog act hierarchy from above. \nYou may assign multiple dialog act types if appropriate. \nWhere possible you should prefer the more specific dialog act types (second level of the hierarchy) over their more general variants.\n\nPlease output your answer as a single line containing a comma-separated list of assigned dialog act types.\n"}, {"sid": 1688, "prompt": "\nYour task is to find which types of dialog acts occur in an email segment. \nThere is a two level hierarchy of dialog acts described below (dialog act types are given in quotes).\n\n1. \"InformationProviding\" -- Any type of providing information.\n1.1. \"Agreement\" --  Agreeing with opinion or accepting a task.\n1.2. \"Answer\" --  Answering a question.\n1.3. \"ContextSetting\" -- Providing context before other dialog acts.\n1.4. \"Disagreement\" -- Disagreeing with opinion on rejecting a task.\n1.5. \"Extension\" Natural continuation of the previous segment.\n1.6. \"NeutralResponse\" -- Response without clear agreement or disagreement.\n1.7. \"ProposeAction\" -- Propose an actionable activity.\n1.8. \"StateDecision\" -- Explicitly express a decision.\n2. \"InformationSeeking\" -- Any type of seeking information \n2.1. \"ClarificationElicitation\" Expresses need for further elaboration.\n2.2. \"Question\" Any type of question.\n3. \"Social\" -- Social acts (thanking, apologizing etc.) \n3.1. \"Thanking\" -- Conveying thanks.

Thanks for the comment.\n\nThe email segment where you should find dialog acts is given below:\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nExactly.\n\nMy argument is based on my opinion that the current proposal is not optimal in sense that it loses the signal that was carried in one of the duplicated packets (one that is being delivered later), while requiring the endpoint to detect duplicates, which IMO is unnecessary.\n\nConsider the case where an endpoint receives two packets that are duplicate, one with the CE bit set and the other one without. The signal sent by the approach used in the PR will depend on the order of the delivery of the two packets. If the packet with the CE bit set is delivered first, the sender will notice more congestion than is should, because the fact that the second packet did not have the CE bit set will not be notified. If the packet without the CE bit set is delivered first, the sender will notice less congestion than it should, because the fact that the second packet did have the CE bit set will not be notified.\n\nThe reason why such issue exists is because you process the packet before updating the counter. I am saying that it might be worth reconsidering the approach, _especially if_ we are going to be required to detect duplicates on the endpoint as a byproduct of the approach.\n\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/quicwg/base-drafts/issues/1405#issuecomment-393743048\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nPlease assign to the above email segment dialog act types given in quotes in the dialog act hierarchy from above. \nYou may assign multiple dialog act types if appropriate. \nWhere possible you should prefer the more specific dialog act types (second level of the hierarchy) over their more general variants.\n\nPlease output your answer as a single line containing a comma-separated list of assigned dialog act types.\n"}, {"sid": 1693, "prompt": "\nYour task is to find which types of dialog acts occur in an email segment. \nThere is a two level hierarchy of dialog acts described below (dialog act types are given in quotes).\n\n1. \"InformationProviding\" -- Any type of providing information.\n1.1. \"Agreement\" --  Agreeing with opinion or accepting a task.\n1.2. \"Answer\" --  Answering a question.\n1.3. \"ContextSetting\" -- Providing context before other dialog acts.\n1.4. \"Disagreement\" -- Disagreeing with opinion on rejecting a task.\n1.5. \"Extension\" Natural continuation of the previous segment.\n1.6. \"NeutralResponse\" -- Response without clear agreement or disagreement.\n1.7. \"ProposeAction\" -- Propose an actionable activity.\n1.8. \"StateDecision\" -- Explicitly express a decision.\n2. \"InformationSeeking\" -- Any type of seeking information \n2.1. \"ClarificationElicitation\" Expresses need for further elaboration.\n2.2. \"Question\" Any type of question.\n3. \"Social\" -- Social acts (thanking, apologizing etc.) \n3.1. \"Thanking\" -- Conveying thanks.

We have two broad\noptions which need to be described in detail.\n\nThe method that I have been assuming does use muxing. The RS sends the\nunicast burst back to the UDP port number on the RR that sent the\nRAMS-R. This allows transparent operation through NAT. There is a single\nUDP port, and the transaction is initiated by the \"client\", so it is NAT\nfriendly.\n\nThere are quite a few ways we could handle the case in which muxing is\nnot used. We could add a parameter to the RAMS-R, use another RTCP\npacket in the same compound packet, define the port numbers as a\nrelationship to the opened port (not attractive), or define something in\nthe SDP (also not attractive). I personally like the \"RAMS-R optional\nfield\" approach, but I think this should be a topic that we consider in\ndetail once we have a WG item.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nPlease assign to the above email segment dialog act types given in quotes in the dialog act hierarchy from above. \nYou may assign multiple dialog act types if appropriate. \nWhere possible you should prefer the more specific dialog act types (second level of the hierarchy) over their more general variants.\n\nPlease output your answer as a single line containing a comma-separated list of assigned dialog act types.\n"}, {"sid": 1737, "prompt": "\nYour task is to find which types of dialog acts occur in an email segment. \nThere is a two level hierarchy of dialog acts described below (dialog act types are given in quotes).\n\n1. \"InformationProviding\" -- Any type of providing information.\n1.1. \"Agreement\" --  Agreeing with opinion or accepting a task.\n1.2. \"Answer\" --  Answering a question.\n1.3. \"ContextSetting\" -- Providing context before other dialog acts.\n1.4. \"Disagreement\" -- Disagreeing with opinion on rejecting a task.\n1.5. \"Extension\" Natural continuation of the previous segment.\n1.6. \"NeutralResponse\" -- Response without clear agreement or disagreement.\n1.7. \"ProposeAction\" -- Propose an actionable activity.\n1.8. \"StateDecision\" -- Explicitly express a decision.\n2. \"InformationSeeking\" -- Any type of seeking information \n2.1. \"ClarificationElicitation\" Expresses need for further elaboration.\n2.2. \"Question\" Any type of question.\n3. \"Social\" -- Social acts (thanking, apologizing etc.) \n3.1. \"Thanking\" -- Conveying thanks.

Admittedly, I don't know much about RTSP beyond its basics. However, I doubt how much it applies in our case. \"Unicast\" in RTSP context mostly refers to video-on-demand kind of applications where the primary distribution is over unicast. In contrast, our primary distribution is over multicast, and we use unicast as a repair stream. Thus, I still believe the SDP we have should work fine. RS gathers the IP address of the RR when it receives the RAMS request. The samething happens when RR sends a NACK for requesting retransmissions.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nPlease assign to the above email segment dialog act types given in quotes in the dialog act hierarchy from above. \nYou may assign multiple dialog act types if appropriate. \nWhere possible you should prefer the more specific dialog act types (second level of the hierarchy) over their more general variants.\n\nPlease output your answer as a single line containing a comma-separated list of assigned dialog act types.\n"}, {"sid": 5975, "prompt": "\nYour task is to find which types of dialog acts occur in an email segment. \nThere is a two level hierarchy of dialog acts described below (dialog act types are given in quotes).\n\n1. \"InformationProviding\" -- Any type of providing information.\n1.1. \"Agreement\" --  Agreeing with opinion or accepting a task.\n1.2. \"Answer\" --  Answering a question.\n1.3. \"ContextSetting\" -- Providing context before other dialog acts.\n1.4. \"Disagreement\" -- Disagreeing with opinion on rejecting a task.\n1.5. \"Extension\" Natural continuation of the previous segment.\n1.6. \"NeutralResponse\" -- Response without clear agreement or disagreement.\n1.7. \"ProposeAction\" -- Propose an actionable activity.\n1.8. \"StateDecision\" -- Explicitly express a decision.\n2. \"InformationSeeking\" -- Any type of seeking information \n2.1. \"ClarificationElicitation\" Expresses need for further elaboration.\n2.2. \"Question\" Any type of question.\n3. \"Social\" -- Social acts (thanking, apologizing etc.) \n3.1. \"Thanking\" -- Conveying thanks.

Muxing sounds reasonable, and we may or may not mandate it, I am not sure at this point. An alternative could be that RR opens ports on its NAT device and includes them in the request message it sends. These could be in RAMS-R TLV extensions, or could be a separate RTCP packet solely for this purpose within the same RTCP compound packet that carries the RAMS-R. I believe Bill mentioned these briefly in his earlier email. We are open to suggestions at this point and the NAT section will cover these issues once we have a WG item.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nPlease assign to the above email segment dialog act types given in quotes in the dialog act hierarchy from above. \nYou may assign multiple dialog act types if appropriate. \nWhere possible you should prefer the more specific dialog act types (second level of the hierarchy) over their more general variants.\n\nPlease output your answer as a single line containing a comma-separated list of assigned dialog act types.\n"}, {"sid": 5977, "prompt": "\nYour task is to find which types of dialog acts occur in an email segment. \nThere is a two level hierarchy of dialog acts described below (dialog act types are given in quotes).\n\n1. \"InformationProviding\" -- Any type of providing information.\n1.1. \"Agreement\" --  Agreeing with opinion or accepting a task.\n1.2. \"Answer\" --  Answering a question.\n1.3. \"ContextSetting\" -- Providing context before other dialog acts.\n1.4. \"Disagreement\" -- Disagreeing with opinion on rejecting a task.\n1.5. \"Extension\" Natural continuation of the previous segment.\n1.6. \"NeutralResponse\" -- Response without clear agreement or disagreement.\n1.7. \"ProposeAction\" -- Propose an actionable activity.\n1.8. \"StateDecision\" -- Explicitly express a decision.\n2. \"InformationSeeking\" -- Any type of seeking information \n2.1. \"ClarificationElicitation\" Expresses need for further elaboration.\n2.2. \"Question\" Any type of question.\n3. \"Social\" -- Social acts (thanking, apologizing etc.) \n3.1. \"Thanking\" -- Conveying thanks.

Absent a compelling reason for more,\nlet's just pick one (for now).\n\nAnd we do need to provide for algorithm agility. Unfortunately, that\nis much trickier than merely parameterizing ciphers - we also need to\nunderstand the negotiation of cipher suites and prevent downgrade\nattacks.  Here's some discussion on the topic:\nhttps://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7696\n\nFor good or ill, other negotiations (e.g. NTS version number) may also\nprovide opportunities for downgrade. Which means we may be also to\naddress multiple vulnerabilities at once.\n\nOne step toward addressing all of this might be to extend the ntp\nclient config file to include a bit for \"this name server is expected\nto use NTS (version #blah)\".  Perhaps cipher suite info could be in\nthe same config file or in the server's certs?\n\nLastly, do not be afraid to roll a new RFC to introduce a new\nalgorithm. While it makes sense to have an IANA registry for cipher\nsuites, \"standards action\" might be a good choice of policy to add a\nnew entry into that registry.\n\n-- Sam\n\nntpwg mailing list\nntpwg@lists.ntp.org\nhttp://lists.ntp.org/listinfo/ntpwg\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nPlease assign to the above email segment dialog act types given in quotes in the dialog act hierarchy from above. \nYou may assign multiple dialog act types if appropriate. \nWhere possible you should prefer the more specific dialog act types (second level of the hierarchy) over their more general variants.\n\nPlease output your answer as a single line containing a comma-separated list of assigned dialog act types.\n"}, {"sid": 2161, "prompt": "\nYour task is to find which types of dialog acts occur in an email segment. \nThere is a two level hierarchy of dialog acts described below (dialog act types are given in quotes).\n\n1. \"InformationProviding\" -- Any type of providing information.\n1.1. \"Agreement\" --  Agreeing with opinion or accepting a task.\n1.2. \"Answer\" --  Answering a question.\n1.3. \"ContextSetting\" -- Providing context before other dialog acts.\n1.4. \"Disagreement\" -- Disagreeing with opinion on rejecting a task.\n1.5. \"Extension\" Natural continuation of the previous segment.\n1.6. \"NeutralResponse\" -- Response without clear agreement or disagreement.\n1.7. \"ProposeAction\" -- Propose an actionable activity.\n1.8. \"StateDecision\" -- Explicitly express a decision.\n2. \"InformationSeeking\" -- Any type of seeking information \n2.1. \"ClarificationElicitation\" Expresses need for further elaboration.\n2.2. \"Question\" Any type of question.\n3. \"Social\" -- Social acts (thanking, apologizing etc.) \n3.1. \"Thanking\" -- Conveying thanks.

The reason is that in RTSP 2.0 the RTSP client\nis not to retransmit any RTSP requests. It relies on TCP for the\nrequests to be delivered to the next hop RTSP agent. TCP will perform\nany necessary retransmission. This way the receiving agent will not be\nforced to deal with multiple duplicated of requests.\n\nThis is of course not possible if one would use UDP. However, due to\nlack of interest in UDP transport of RTSP messages this has not be\nspecified for RTSP 2.0.\n\nWhen it comes to a RTSP 2.0 agents handling of RTSP 1.0 messages, that\nhave to be implemented as best can according to RFC 2326. This will mean\nduplication handling.\n\nThe main point is that the messages are clearly indicating RTSP version,\nand thus an RTSP 2.0 message and its protocol interactions can be held\nto the tighter and more well defined behaviour of the new specification.\nIt is difficult to define how to correctly handle something that is\nunderspecified.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nPlease assign to the above email segment dialog act types given in quotes in the dialog act hierarchy from above. \nYou may assign multiple dialog act types if appropriate. \nWhere possible you should prefer the more specific dialog act types (second level of the hierarchy) over their more general variants.\n\nPlease output your answer as a single line containing a comma-separated list of assigned dialog act types.\n"}, {"sid": 2165, "prompt": "\nYour task is to find which types of dialog acts occur in an email segment. \nThere is a two level hierarchy of dialog acts described below (dialog act types are given in quotes).\n\n1. \"InformationProviding\" -- Any type of providing information.\n1.1. \"Agreement\" --  Agreeing with opinion or accepting a task.\n1.2. \"Answer\" --  Answering a question.\n1.3. \"ContextSetting\" -- Providing context before other dialog acts.\n1.4. \"Disagreement\" -- Disagreeing with opinion on rejecting a task.\n1.5. \"Extension\" Natural continuation of the previous segment.\n1.6. \"NeutralResponse\" -- Response without clear agreement or disagreement.\n1.7. \"ProposeAction\" -- Propose an actionable activity.\n1.8. \"StateDecision\" -- Explicitly express a decision.\n2. \"InformationSeeking\" -- Any type of seeking information \n2.1. \"ClarificationElicitation\" Expresses need for further elaboration.\n2.2. \"Question\" Any type of question.\n3. \"Social\" -- Social acts (thanking, apologizing etc.) \n3.1. \"Thanking\" -- Conveying thanks.

I have not yet anywhere\nnear to catch up on my email. Thus, I have not read more than some few\nof your emails.\n\nFirst of all, I see just from the volume that you appreciate how broken\nthe specification text of RFC 2326 is. That is why we started back in\n2003 to produce an updated version. That work has finally in principal\nconcluded by the approval for publication of\ndraft-ietf-mmusic-rfc2326bis. The only thing preventing this document\nfrom being published as an RFC is a missing normative reference.\n\nThus, we are currently in a state where it is difficult to make any\nsignificant changes to the text. Wording corrections would still be\npossible to fix. Also if you find anything that is so significant that\nit must be corrected then we\n\nFiling Errata on RFC 2326 is also not particular useful.\n\nHaving said that I will attempt to answer your issue below.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nPlease assign to the above email segment dialog act types given in quotes in the dialog act hierarchy from above. \nYou may assign multiple dialog act types if appropriate. \nWhere possible you should prefer the more specific dialog act types (second level of the hierarchy) over their more general variants.\n\nPlease output your answer as a single line containing a comma-separated list of assigned dialog act types.\n"}, {"sid": 2189, "prompt": "\nYour task is to find which types of dialog acts occur in an email segment. \nThere is a two level hierarchy of dialog acts described below (dialog act types are given in quotes).\n\n1. \"InformationProviding\" -- Any type of providing information.\n1.1. \"Agreement\" --  Agreeing with opinion or accepting a task.\n1.2. \"Answer\" --  Answering a question.\n1.3. \"ContextSetting\" -- Providing context before other dialog acts.\n1.4. \"Disagreement\" -- Disagreeing with opinion on rejecting a task.\n1.5. \"Extension\" Natural continuation of the previous segment.\n1.6. \"NeutralResponse\" -- Response without clear agreement or disagreement.\n1.7. \"ProposeAction\" -- Propose an actionable activity.\n1.8. \"StateDecision\" -- Explicitly express a decision.\n2. \"InformationSeeking\" -- Any type of seeking information \n2.1. \"ClarificationElicitation\" Expresses need for further elaboration.\n2.2. \"Question\" Any type of question.\n3. \"Social\" -- Social acts (thanking, apologizing etc.) \n3.1. \"Thanking\" -- Conveying thanks.

Security Token Replay\n>    The goal of the Token Binding protocol is to prevent attackers from\n>    exporting and replaying security tokens, thereby impersonating\n>    legitimate users and gaining access to protected resources.  Bound\n>    tokens can still be replayed by the malware present in the User\n>    Agent.  In order to export the token to another machine and\n>    successfully replay it, the attacker also needs to export the\n>    corresponding private key.  Token Binding private keys are therefore\n>    high-value assets and SHOULD be strongly protected, ideally by\n>    generating them in a hardware security module that prevents key\n>    export.\n>    The manner in which a token is bound to the TLS layer is application-\n>    defined and beyond the scope of this document.  However, the\n>    resulting bound token needs to be integrity-protected, so that an\n>    attacker cannot remove the binding or substitute a Token Binding ID\n>    of their choice without detection.\n> 8.2.

At least in our implementation, this change reduces the number of SW components that need to understand the structure of TB IDs.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nPlease assign to the above email segment dialog act types given in quotes in the dialog act hierarchy from above. \nYou may assign multiple dialog act types if appropriate. \nWhere possible you should prefer the more specific dialog act types (second level of the hierarchy) over their more general variants.\n\nPlease output your answer as a single line containing a comma-separated list of assigned dialog act types.\n"}, {"sid": 2246, "prompt": "\nYour task is to find which types of dialog acts occur in an email segment. \nThere is a two level hierarchy of dialog acts described below (dialog act types are given in quotes).\n\n1. \"InformationProviding\" -- Any type of providing information.\n1.1. \"Agreement\" --  Agreeing with opinion or accepting a task.\n1.2. \"Answer\" --  Answering a question.\n1.3. \"ContextSetting\" -- Providing context before other dialog acts.\n1.4. \"Disagreement\" -- Disagreeing with opinion on rejecting a task.\n1.5. \"Extension\" Natural continuation of the previous segment.\n1.6. \"NeutralResponse\" -- Response without clear agreement or disagreement.\n1.7. \"ProposeAction\" -- Propose an actionable activity.\n1.8. \"StateDecision\" -- Explicitly express a decision.\n2. \"InformationSeeking\" -- Any type of seeking information \n2.1. \"ClarificationElicitation\" Expresses need for further elaboration.\n2.2. \"Question\" Any type of question.\n3. \"Social\" -- Social acts (thanking, apologizing etc.) \n3.1. \"Thanking\" -- Conveying thanks.
